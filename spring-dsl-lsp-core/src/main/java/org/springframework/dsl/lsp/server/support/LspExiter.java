/**
 * Interface for exiting the JVM. This abstraction is useful in cases where
 * {@code LSP} server is running embedded in a jvm with other services and raw
 * {@code JVM} exit is not possible. For tests order to allow classes that make
 * System.exit calls to be testable, since calling System.exit during a unit
 * test would cause the entire jvm to finish.
 * <p>
 * This interface is really meant to attempt an exit when {@code LSP} client
 * sends {@code exit} message and we want to make sure jvm exists fast in cases
 * where {@code IDE} controls process lifecycle. However when running i.e.
 * embedded in a webserver for {@code websocket} mode, we don't want
 * {@code LSP Client} to kill whole server with its {@code exit} message.
