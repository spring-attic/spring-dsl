/**
 * {@code Scope} is a dictionary of symbols that are grouped together by some
 * lexical construct in the input language. Examples include {@code structs},
 * {@code functions}, {@code code blocks}, {@code argument lists}, etc...
 * <p>
 * Scopes all have an enclosing scope that encloses them lexically. In other
 * words, am I wrapped in a class? a function? a code block?
 * <p>
 * This is distinguished from the parent scope. The parent scope is usually the
 * enclosing scope, but in the case of inheritance, it is the superclass rather
 * than the enclosing scope. Otherwise, the global scope would be considered the
 * parent scope of a class. When resolving symbols, we look up the parent scope
 * chain not the enclosing scope chain.
 * <p>
 * For convenience of code using this library, a bunch of methods have been
 * added one can use to get lots of useful information from a scope, but they
 * don't necessarily define what a scope is.
